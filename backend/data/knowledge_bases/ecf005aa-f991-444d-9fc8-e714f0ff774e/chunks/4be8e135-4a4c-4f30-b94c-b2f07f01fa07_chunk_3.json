A virtual \nclassroom solution should help organizations and education institutions gain complete control \nover their content. The platform should also provide built-in security measures, such as \nauthentication and access controls, which help prevent unauthorized access, usage, and \ndownload of educational and sensitive data. \n \n \nCase study 3 \nVirtual Hospital \nA virtual hospital is a full-scale hospital that has no physical location, meaning a patient cannot \nsubmit analyses or have surgery performed in such a facility. On the other hand, such a hospital \ncan offer a range of online consultations, helping patients to avoid both traveling to a location \nand waiting in line.  \n \nTypes: -  \ni) \nA General Hospital: - This type of facility works as a full-scale remote hospital \nproviding their patients with the opportunity to book an e-visit with a specialist \ndoctor without the need to wait for the appointment. In the US, this wait time is \n\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n\none of the major pain points accountable for patients\u2019 health deterioration. \nAccording to the OECD report on health policies in the selected countries, 28% of \nUS patients wait for their appointment for over a month. \nii) \nChronic Condition Management Hospital: - There are virtual hospitals dedicated \nto managing chronic diseases. There are several virtual hospitals dedicated to \nremote management of diabetes, cancer, chronic lung and kidney disease, and \nother conditions. \niii) \nTele Paramedicine Hospital: - Such hospitals have a team of doctors operating in \na call-center environment. The team takes incoming telecalls and consults \nclinicians and paramedics in the field, helping resolve complex clinical issues. Tele \nparamedicine proves to be a lifeline for small or rural hospitals that have a \nshortage of specialist doctors on-premises. The external team can supervise the \nhospital staff and guide them through medical procedures in case of an emergency \nor when a patient is in a life-threatening state. Besides, medical specialists working \nat such virtual hospitals can assess a patient\u2019s condition on the go and offer an \nadequate treatment plan without delays. \n \n \nWhen a virtual hospital can also provide emergency care, a remote patient monitoring \nsolution on the patient\u2019s side should be implemented to notify the call center and the \nhospital about a potentially dangerous situation. On the provider\u2019s side, it would also be \nreasonable to integrate the virtual hospital with clinical decision support tools to facilitate \ndiagnosing and improve the patient experience. Besides, proper care delivery also calls \nfor integrating with data analytics solutions. These tools enable doctors to track a \npatient\u2019s health status over time and make well-grounded treatment decisions.",
